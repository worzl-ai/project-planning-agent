# Tools and Integrations for Project Planning Agent

This document outlines the key tools and integrations required for the Project Planning Agent, designed to operate within the Google Cloud/Vertex AI stack.

## Core Intelligence

1.  **Vertex AI (Gemini Models):**
    *   **Purpose:** Understanding project requirements, breaking down high-level goals into tasks, generating task descriptions, estimating effort (potentially based on historical data or simple heuristics), and structuring project plans.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   Parsing user requests for new projects or features.
        *   Generating Work Breakdown Structures (WBS).
        *   Creating task lists with descriptions, dependencies, and potential assignments.
        *   Structuring feature definitions based on requirements.
        *   Generating project timelines or roadmaps (Gantt chart data, milestone lists).
    *   **Integration:** Via Vertex AI SDK/API calls within the agent's Python code (`04_agent_project_planning_structure.py`).

## Data Sources & Input

1.  **User Interface / API:**
    *   **Purpose:** Receiving project briefs, feature requests, and updates from users or other systems.
    *   **Integration:** Via Pub/Sub messages originating from a user dashboard or potentially direct API calls if the agent exposes an endpoint.
2.  **Existing Project Documentation (Optional):**
    *   **Purpose:** Analyzing existing requirement documents, design specifications, or previous project plans to inform new planning.
    *   **Integration:** Could involve retrieving documents from GCS or a knowledge base, potentially using the Document Manager Agent (`12_agent_document_manager_structure.py`) for processing.

## Communication & Workflow

1.  **Google Cloud Pub/Sub:**
    *   **Purpose:** Receiving planning requests and publishing generated plans, task lists, or updates.
    *   **Usage:** Subscribing to `agent-requests` topic (filtered for its ID), publishing results to `agent-responses`.
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries for Python (`06_a2a_communication_process.md`).

## Output & Storage

1.  **Firestore / Cloud SQL / Other Database:**
    *   **Purpose:** Storing structured project data, including project details, feature lists, tasks, dependencies, milestones, status, and assignments.
    *   **Usage:** Creating and updating records representing the project plan components.
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries.
2.  **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):**
    *   **Purpose:** Storing generated project plan documents (e.g., exported roadmaps, detailed feature descriptions) if not stored directly in a structured database.
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries.

## External Integrations (Optional but Recommended)

1.  **Project Management Tool APIs (e.g., Jira, Asana, Trello, Google Tasks/Sheets):**
    *   **Purpose:** Syncing generated tasks, features, or milestones directly into the team's preferred project management tool.
    *   **Usage:** Creating new issues/tasks, updating statuses (potentially based on feedback from other agents or systems), linking related items.
    *   **Integration:** API calls to the respective services. Requires handling authentication (OAuth 2.0 or API keys) and mapping the agent's plan structure to the tool's data model. Credentials require secure management (Secret Manager).

## Supporting Tools

1.  **Google Cloud Logging/Monitoring:**
    *   **Purpose:** Tracking agent activity, planning processes, performance, and errors.
    *   **Integration:** Standard Python logging libraries configured to send logs to Cloud Logging.
2.  **Google Secret Manager:**
    *   **Purpose:** Securely storing API keys or OAuth credentials for external project management tools.
    *   **Integration:** Using Google Cloud Client Libraries to retrieve secrets at runtime.
